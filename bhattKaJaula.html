            <p>
                Normally, any Indian delicacy is incomplete without spices, but let me tell you this Bhatt ka Jaula is made
                without any spices. It is made with just two things – Bhatt (black soybean) and rice. To make this dish
                wholesome, it is best served with Kadhi (prepared by mixing curd, besan, and spices) or ‘Hara Dhaniya Namak’
                (Green Coriander Salt). It is my favorite dish and if asked which Kumauni cuisine I will prefer to have any
                time, this would be it.

                    <ol>
                        <li>Wash bhatt nicely. Take washed Bhatt in a big bowl and soak them in water for 6-8 hours. I soak
                            them overnight if making jaulaa for lunch.</li>
                        <li>Wash and soak rice for atleast 30 minutes. If soaked longer it will do but donot soak it
                            overnight. </li>
                        <li>Drain water from soaked Bhatt. Keep water aside, donot throw it. </li>
                        <li>In a grinder-mixer grind the soaked Bhatt to coarse thick paste, adding water in little amounts.
                        </li>
                        <li>Keep remaining water for cooking. It is rich in nutrients. </li>
                        <li>Pulse soaked rice for a minute or two to break rice into small pieces. </li>
                        <li>Take a iron /cast iron preferably, in absence of iron /cast iron wok take any thick bottomed
                            deep container for cooking. </li>
                        <li>Put soaked pulsed rice with 200 ml. water and start heating on high heat with occasional
                            stirring. </li>
                        <li>Once water comes to boil reduce heat to low and cook till the rice is semi cooked. It will take
                            nearly 10 minutes. </li>
                        <li>Add Bhatt paste and 200 ml water and mix nicely. </li>
                        <li>Bring heat to high and keep stirring not allowing anything to settle at the bottom. </li>
                        <li>Once the whole thing starts boiling bring the heat to low. </li>
                        <li>Now starts process of cooking on low heat, stirring and adding water in small amounts.</li>
                        <li>Keep cooking for atleast for an hour more adding water 100 ml at one time and stirring it so
                            that contents do not settle at the bottom and get burnt.</li>
                        <li>Keep scrapping the sides also while stirring so that deposit on the sides do not become dry and
                            hard. </li>
                        <li>By and large in one hour cooking almost 750 ml. water will get used. </li>
                        <li>The rice and beans paste will be cooked soft and nice. Rice grains will be broken nicely.</li>
                        <li>Add 2 teaspoons rice flour and mix nicely.</li>
                        <li>Add 1 teaspoon salt and 50 ml. water. Cook on high heat for 2-3 minutes with continuous
                            stirring. </li>
                        <li>Salt is added in less amount because in kumaon Bhatt jaulaa is eaten with Chatpata lahsuniya
                            namak (spicy salt mix) made by grinding salt-garlic/duna-green chilies-fresh coriander leafs.
                        </li>
                        <li>If one wants then after switching off heat spicy salt can be added according to the taste and
                            then covered to cool. No cooking to be done after adding spicy salt mix to preserve raw taste of
                            garlic-green chilies - coriander leafs. </li>
                        <li>Switch off the heat and cover the wok nicely. </li>
                        <li>Black Turtle Beans-rice Polenta / Bhatt ka jaulaa is ready. </li>
                        <li>Heat before serving. </li>
                        <li>Enjoy Bhatt ka jaulaa with spicy salt mix. I love besan ke Dubke (plain kadi) as accompaniment
                            with jaulaa along with lahsuniya chatpata namak.</li>
