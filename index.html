        <h1>Kumaoni Raita</h1>
        <image height="200" src="FullDish1.png"></image>
        <p>Raita is a dish prepared in most parts of India that consists of vegetables, salads, or spices, depending on
            their recipes. Kumaoni Raita is easy to make raita that goes on well with your daily meals. Thus, it is a
            special kind of Uttarakhandi dish prepared with curd, cucumber, and the specialty- mustard seeds being its
            main ingredients. Supporting ingredients are green chilies, salt, and hing (asafoetida) as per taste. Locals
            also call this cuisine ‘Pahadi Kheere Ka Raita’.</p>

        <h1>Bhatt Ka Jaula</h1>
        <image height="200" src="FullDish2.png"></image>
        <p>
            Normally, any Indian delicacy is incomplete without spices, but let me tell you this Bhatt ka Jaula is made
            without any spices. It is made with just two things – Bhatt (black soybean) and rice. To make this dish
            wholesome, it is best served with Kadhi (prepared by mixing curd, besan, and spices) or ‘Hara Dhaniya Namak’
            (Green Coriander Salt). It is my favorite dish and if asked which Kumauni cuisine I will prefer to have any
            time, this would be it.

                <ol>
                    <li>Wash bhatt nicely. Take washed Bhatt in a big bowl and soak them in water for 6-8 hours. I soak
                        them overnight if making jaulaa for lunch.</li>
                    <li>Wash and soak rice for atleast 30 minutes. If soaked longer it will do but donot soak it
                        overnight. </li>
                    <li>Drain water from soaked Bhatt. Keep water aside, donot throw it. </li>
                    <li>In a grinder-mixer grind the soaked Bhatt to coarse thick paste, adding water in little amounts.
                    </li>
                    <li>Keep remaining water for cooking. It is rich in nutrients. </li>
                    <li>Pulse soaked rice for a minute or two to break rice into small pieces. </li>
                    <li>Take a iron /cast iron preferably, in absence of iron /cast iron wok take any thick bottomed
                        deep container for cooking. </li>
                    <li>Put soaked pulsed rice with 200 ml. water and start heating on high heat with occasional
                        stirring. </li>
                    <li>Once water comes to boil reduce heat to low and cook till the rice is semi cooked. It will take
                        nearly 10 minutes. </li>
                    <li>Add Bhatt paste and 200 ml water and mix nicely. </li>
                    <li>Bring heat to high and keep stirring not allowing anything to settle at the bottom. </li>
                    <li>Once the whole thing starts boiling bring the heat to low. </li>
                    <li>Now starts process of cooking on low heat, stirring and adding water in small amounts.</li>
                    <li>Keep cooking for atleast for an hour more adding water 100 ml at one time and stirring it so
                        that contents do not settle at the bottom and get burnt.</li>
                    <li>Keep scrapping the sides also while stirring so that deposit on the sides do not become dry and
                        hard. </li>
                    <li>By and large in one hour cooking almost 750 ml. water will get used. </li>
                    <li>The rice and beans paste will be cooked soft and nice. Rice grains will be broken nicely.</li>
                    <li>Add 2 teaspoons rice flour and mix nicely.</li>
                    <li>Add 1 teaspoon salt and 50 ml. water. Cook on high heat for 2-3 minutes with continuous
                        stirring. </li>
                    <li>Salt is added in less amount because in kumaon Bhatt jaulaa is eaten with Chatpata lahsuniya
                        namak (spicy salt mix) made by grinding salt-garlic/duna-green chilies-fresh coriander leafs.
                    </li>
                    <li>If one wants then after switching off heat spicy salt can be added according to the taste and
                        then covered to cool. No cooking to be done after adding spicy salt mix to preserve raw taste of
                        garlic-green chilies - coriander leafs. </li>
                    <li>Switch off the heat and cover the wok nicely. </li>
                    <li>Black Turtle Beans-rice Polenta / Bhatt ka jaulaa is ready. </li>
                    <li>Heat before serving. </li>
                    <li>Enjoy Bhatt ka jaulaa with spicy salt mix. I love besan ke Dubke (plain kadi) as accompaniment
                        with jaulaa along with lahsuniya chatpata namak.</li>

        <p>Originating in the laps of Garhwal, Dubuk, also known as Dubke is an authentically traditional dish from the
            laps of Uttarakhand. It is a lentil soup, with the main ingredient being Gahat/Kulthi (Horse gram) or Bhatt

            other regular ingredients like turmeric and red chili powder, garlic, etc. It is a proper winter dish in the

        <h1>Bhaang ki chutney</h1>
        <image height="200" src="FullDish4.png"></image>
        <p>Bhang ki chutney has to be my favorite from the lot because nothing beats it. Simply making Thandai out of
            bhang is not enough and this chutney from the interiors of Uttarakhand just might be the new thing you need
            to try. The process is quite simple as well. All you have to do is roast the bhang seeds and then grind them
            in a mixer. To the seeds, add green chilies, lemon juice, mint leaves, coriander, water, and salt and grind
            to a paste. Voila! The chutney is ready.</p>

        <p>Another deliciously healthy Pahari recipe you should definitely try is the Mandua Ki Roti. Making this dish
            is very simple which is contrary to the complex name of the dish. For this recipe, Ragi flour is simply
            kneaded with salt, carrot, yogurt, green chili, and spring onions into a dough. After resting this dough for
            a few minutes, you are good to go to make Chappatis out of this flour. The process of making the Chappatis
            remains the same while the nutritional value of the food increases ten folds.</p>
