        <p>Another deliciously healthy Pahari recipe you should definitely try is the Mandua Ki Roti. Making this dish
            is very simple which is contrary to the complex name of the dish. For this recipe, Ragi flour is simply
            kneaded with salt, carrot, yogurt, green chili, and spring onions into a dough. After resting this dough for
            a few minutes, you are good to go to make Chappatis out of this flour. The process of making the Chappatis
            remains the same while the nutritional value of the food increases ten folds.</p>
